**Game description:** Doginator is a “cops and robbers” style game, but themed as dogs and dog catchers.
There are two teams, the dogs, and the dog catchers. The dogs must try and stay away from the dog catchers, and the dog catchers must try and catch the dogs.
If a dog is caught, it is sent to the pound. A dog in the pound can be freed by another dog, but if both dogs are caught and sent to the pound the game is over.
The game will have a timer, and if the timer runs out, the dogs win.
There are some skills for both human and dog to help them in the game:
Human can shoot a plunge to fly around on the map and place a trap bone on floor that will force the dog to eat it until the dog struggle away.
Dogs can pee on the floor that will make the human slip on it and they can sprint for a while. There are also 2 dog houses on the map that can teleport to the other house after walking into one.

### More about the game
This game is created by a team of 6 students using C++ and OpenGL for graphics. My part in this project is creating the game engine (game loop and physics), game logic, modeling, animations, map design and game graphics.
