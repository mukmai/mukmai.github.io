**Game description:** Good Dog is a hybrid-casual RTS  mobile game. In this game, you play as one of the bouncers, and to fight against three other bouncers in a free-for-all battle on a board. The objective is to outlast the other bouncers and be the last one alive by either destroying your opponents directly or by letting them destroy each other.
The battle is turn-based, each turn you and your opponents select a cell nearby to jump on to trigger different effects, some to attack opponents, some to heal yourself.
