### About myself

My name is Cheuk Him Deacon Kum and I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. I mainly focus on game developing related field such as computer graphics and game engine and of course game design. I chose this field because I have been a gamer for a very long time and I would also like to create game that people will also enjoy playing it. I had a couple game related projects in my school years and some of those led to an internship in Nanome, a company that use Unity3D and oculus rift to represent 3d graphs and chemical bonds in VR. And now I am actively looking for a full-time position related to game industry.

Please hire me. lol
